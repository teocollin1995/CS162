Projects for cs162

This is a collection of projects that I contributed a solution to on my own as part of the Honors Intro to CS II wiki. The wiki pages corresponding to each code contribution contain my solution and other people's solutions and are avaliable in html alongside the code files containing my solution. What follows is a list of the projects with a link to each wiki page. I go by the name teocollin on the wiki. 

Also, I like to think of this as an archive of a small part of the wiki.
